## User Features
* Dynamic Search: Users can find products using a lookahead search bar that updates results in real-time as they type.
* Product Pages: Each product has its own detailed page showing the title, image, description, reviews, and pricing information, including any discounts.
* Cart Functionality: Users can add products to the cart from product pages. The cart icon displays the current number of items and directs to the cart page.
* Checkout Process: The cart page allows users to review their order, remove items, and proceed to checkout. Upon successful checkout, users are directed to a success page where the cart is cleared.
